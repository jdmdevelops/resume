        <h3>About</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          I'm a 28-year-old self-taught web developer, passionate about creating
          innovative digital experiences. I live with my girlfriend, our dog
          Aubree, and two cats, Angel and Cookie. In my free time, I love
          exploring the outdoors, learning new skills, and hobbies. I enjoy
          cooking, practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as a blue belt, and swing
          dancing on occasional Saturday nights. To unwind, I find relaxation in
          watching fantasy shows, movies, and playing video games.
